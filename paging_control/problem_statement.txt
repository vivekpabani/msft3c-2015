You are writing a function that will output a paging control that shows up on a webpage. The paging control can be used later to change pages by clicking on them.
At the moment, we only need to generate which pages we need to display.
Input description/format

An input line is composed of the following: 
C,L,X 
Where C, L, and X are integers. C is the current page, L is the last page, and X is the value for the rolling page.

Output description/format

A line of the output is composed of the following: 
First page
Ellipsis (if necessary)
Rolling pages
Ellipsis (if necessary)
Last page
All items are separated by a space
Ellipsis should be printed when there is a page gap between the previous and next item.
The rolling pages include X pages before the current page, the current page, and X pages after the current page
Pages should not be duplicated and cannot be out of bounds
The first page is always 1
In case of an error on the input, write ERR on the line
